  <div class="entry-content"><p>OMG!</p>

<p>The last week.</p>

<p>Group Project is cranking along.  I was informed today that Akbar is not going to be here Thurs or Fri and he wants me to take over where he left off as he felt I&rsquo;d be best in the group for doing so.
This was right after I had just said that I had done a lot of the startup work and now I needed to step down so I can work on my projects that I need to get done.  I know I speak english.  I know I do.  Augh!  Oh well, screw it.  Honestly, I am probably the best to take over from where he&rsquo;s leaving off.  I have a grasp of what needs to get done, I have no problem distributing directions and loads of work to people and telling them to get it done.
And I can pretty much judge who can do what and make sure they have suitable instructions to do what needs to get done.  So I&rsquo;ll figure out how to make it work.
Best I can do.  Besides our project is kick butt cool and I want it to happen and happen well.  I can make sure that happens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 9</p>

<p>Last week did NOT go well.  There were some very NOT cool things said about and to me from a few sources.  Honestly, if I was not this close to the end of class, I would have walked right then and there.  But I am going to see this through even if I have to suck up a bunch of people being &ldquo;challenged&rdquo;.  At that is so me biting my tongue and saying it the nice way.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;m making more progress on the work.  Starting to speed up which is good.  Today is a rough day, its the 4 yr anniversary of Mom passing and I miss her greatly and I miss my family.  But I just need to find a new family.  I need to move on.  This class and getting a job afterwards is a great step towards that.  Gotta love the rebuilding your life process.</p>

<p>Homework is progressing.  I&rsquo;m so over Code School its sad.  Will be glad when I can ditch it.  The CSS level is absolutely driving me berserk, but I figured out if I use the computers at the library I have less problems with it doing its flippy flop thing.</p>

<p>We start the group project this week.  I did a chunk towards it last night/this morning.  It&rsquo;s going to be a Choose Your Own Adventure.  Sounds fun and I like it so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 8</p>

<p>The end is in sight.  I&rsquo;m so far behind I can no longer see the light of day, but heck one step at a time and I&rsquo;ll get as far as I can.</p>

<p>Code School hates my guts or my computer does.  It&rsquo;s like doing the bunny hop.  I finish 3 or 4 pages or levels and then all of a sudden it resets and goes back a bunch of pages/levels.  It passed frustrating awhile ago, however the good thing is - because i have to keep rekeying the same things over and over, I&rsquo;m learning them very very well.  This works too, just is very very slow progress.  I got Fundamentals and Foundations done working on CSS.  Will get there, just takes time.</p>

<p>Gotta start working on my portfolio and get chunks of it done.  I am going to take Sandra up on her offer to help me out.  Turnabout is fairplay.  I helped her with all the other stuff, she can help me with that.  Go team!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 7</p>

<p>I definitely took on more than I can chew with this class, my court/DPP requirements, QAM and trying to find a truck.  My living arrangements are about killing me.  I have been staying over by Ed.  Need to get a vehicle.  Finally unloaded on the doc and they are getting me in for an upper GI.  I&rsquo;m guessing I will have to have surgery almost as soon possible after the class ends.  I&rsquo;m putting it off until then to try and finish this.  But its causing some very severe problems.  I feel like I&rsquo;m getting mule-kicked in the chest on a regular basis.  Many days I can only eat crackers or it gets me sick over and over.  And, of course, knowing this just makes me hungrier for stuff I can&rsquo;t have&hellip;hahha isn&rsquo;t that always the way it is.  We want what we can&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Oh well, as I said before, I&rsquo;m going to get through this.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to be able to finish all the requirements for the class and, honestly at this point, oh well.  I&rsquo;m going to do as much as I can as well as I can so I at least have the learning experience.  If I fail the course, such is life.  I still walk away with what I&rsquo;ve learned.  I gotta learn and do the best I can with what I got to work with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 6 Blog Post</p>

<p>3 letters to describe Week 6&hellip;.and I&rsquo;m still debating between OMG and WTF.</p>

<p>I have been in and out of the hospital.  The challenged individuals who are supposed to be seeing to my medical care didn&rsquo;t bother to send in the paperwork I needed to get the one med that would help with pain.  And it was not a they didn&rsquo;t know any better&hellip;I knew that add'l paperwork had to be filed with the pharmacy.  I had the pharmacy fax it to them, then I called the doc office and told them to look for it and fill it out.  Oh no, apparently they didn&rsquo;t.  So the next day I called the pharmacy and confirmed they did not have it.  Had them refax the paperwork.  I called the doc office again.  Told them they needed to do it.  This was Friday.  Called back later that day to confirm that they did it, and they had not, and the doc was gone for the day/weekend.  I had asked them to call in a painkiller and they wouldn&rsquo;t.  This med was supposed to be an anti-inflammatory.  So now I have neither.  Lots of chest pain, no help.  And if I go to the hospital they won&rsquo;t help me either.  So very frustrated.  Very in pain.  Very behind in my school work because of this and the days in the hospital.</p>

<p>For bonus points, I got the check I was waiting for.  Because its over a certain dollar amount, the bank put a 5 day hold on it.  Wal-Mart would have cashed it if it had not been over a different dollar amount.  So now I have to sit around for a week with no funds while they get around to posting this.  Once they post it, I have to start hunting for a vehicle.  Decided to get a pick up with a camper bed on back.  This will greatly help with my ability to get sleep and stay out of the weather and even getting around.  Plus I have to arrange to move my stuff out of Greg&rsquo;s and put it into storage.  That has to be done on the weekend as well.  Again the list of things I have to do just grows and all in a very small time period to do it.  Very overwhelming.  At this point though I am just digging in my heels, putting on my obstinant mule costume and digging in for the long haul.  I am going to do this, I am going to get through this.  Period. End.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s class.  I missed a bunch.  So I have not had the opportunity to do what I was doing before which was work on a chunk, write down all my questions and get them answered the next day in class and then work on the next chunk.  I&rsquo;m very far behind and I&rsquo;m really really frustrated.  On the flip side, it did point out to everyone I was helping just how much they were relying on me to get them through class.  They&rsquo;re having to learn to be more resourceful.  And for once, some of them get to help <em>me</em> out.  The homework though is extremely misleading and confusing on what they want.  The book doesn&rsquo;t teach it well and the web sites don&rsquo;t follow the pattern the book does and most of them force you to follow the order they want to go.  So very hard to find a way to teach this to myself.  Again adds frustration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 5 Blog Post</p>

<p>This has been a week from&hellip;yeah you get the idea.</p>

<p>Ended up in the hospital for two days.  My heart is not beating right.  Its still messed up and they don&rsquo;t know what is causing it.  Have to follow up with doc.  Ended up wearing a heart monitor for a day to see if I could get the &lsquo;incident&rsquo; to happen again.  It didn&rsquo;t.  Figures.  Anyways, didn&rsquo;t get any of the homework done, I&rsquo;m way behind in class now.  I gotta play catch up for the next couple days.
Nothing like a little stress to add flavor to your day.  Code School is driving me bonkers.  It doesn&rsquo;t ask good questions and the examples they show are clearly doing one thing but its not what they&rsquo;re looking for, they&rsquo;re looking for something totally different as far as the answer.  So a lot of shooting in the dark to find the answers.  It&rsquo;s either that or waste all the points on buying hints.  Don&rsquo;t want to do that either.
But I&rsquo;m glad it took this long for me to get behind.  Now just gotta see how fast I can turn it around and fix it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 4 Blog Post</p>

<p>Ok,</p>

<p>Week 4 is almost up.  We go to Madison UX tomorrow and Saturday.  Spent a lot of the week working on the workbook.  This weeks workbook was a LOT harder than the first one. Covers a LOT of territory.  Functions and control structures.  I think learning the terminology is going to be the more difficult thing because I always had it in my head that these were functions and they&rsquo;re control structures.  And its things like that where its breaking old habits that are stuck in my head the wrong way that is going to be the harder thing to do.</p>

<p>Learning new stuff is easier because you&rsquo;re just straight learning it and learning it right.  Retraining yourself to think different has always been more difficult.  But it can be done and it needs to be or I&rsquo;ll be calling stuff the wrong thing and that will mess up too many people.</p>

<p>The functions like alert and prompt and confirm are simple as pie.  The control structures are all the if, for, else if and do/while loops and loop de hoops (as Sandra calls them)&hellip;..those can get really complex.  But its fun to build them and then try to see where and how I can condense them down and where I wouldn&rsquo;t want to.  I&rsquo;m getting the hang of them and doing most of the coding correctly.  I tend to get hung up on one small part of stuff that I code and that messes up the whole thing.  Like I did one as a string of if commands, but it needed to be else if&rsquo;s and they needed to be connected or it gave the wrong results.  So simply changing it from if&rsquo;s to else ifs and then connecting them made a huge difference on my results.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m putting together a bunch of &ldquo;cheat sheets&rdquo; that I call the D&amp;D&rsquo;s, Down &amp; Dirty&rsquo;s&hellip;I&rsquo;m outlining what each of the chapters are in simpler terms.  I&rsquo;m doing the functions and control structures for Chap 2 right now.  I think its going to help Sandra and some other people out big time in how to figure these things out.  We&rsquo;ll have to see how it goes.  At least the 15 yrs of branch and client training I did at Paychex isn&rsquo;t going to waste.  I&rsquo;m able to use that to help train here in class now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 3
Bit of a crazy week.  Have a lot of people who are hopping on board with me on showing them the workbook stuff.  I do it and figure it out and then I go through it with them and explain it in a variety of ways to get it across to them what they&rsquo;re looking for and how it works.  Am finding that some of us code stuff differently and while it still works&hellip;there are &ldquo;more accurate&rdquo; ways of coding.  I am trying to make sure that I learn the most accurate and most time saving way to code.  As opposed to doing whatever will get it done.</p>
