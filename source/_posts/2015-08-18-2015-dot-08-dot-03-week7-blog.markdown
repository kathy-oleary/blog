Week 7

I definitely took on more than I can chew with this class, my court/DPP requirements, QAM and trying to find a truck.  My living arrangements are about killing me.  I have been staying over by Ed.  Need to get a vehicle.  Finally unloaded on the doc and they are getting me in for an upper GI.  I'm guessing I will have to have surgery almost as soon possible after the class ends.  I'm putting it off until then to try and finish this.  But its causing some very severe problems.  I feel like I'm getting mule-kicked in the chest on a regular basis.  Many days I can only eat crackers or it gets me sick over and over.  And, of course, knowing this just makes me hungrier for stuff I can't have...hahha isn't that always the way it is.  We want what we can't have.  

Oh well, as I said before, I'm going to get through this.  I don't think I'm going to be able to finish all the requirements for the class and, honestly at this point, oh well.  I'm going to do as much as I can as well as I can so I at least have the learning experience.  If I fail the course, such is life.  I still walk away with what I've learned.  I gotta learn and do the best I can with what I got to work with.
