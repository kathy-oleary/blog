Week 5 Blog Post

This has been a week from...yeah you get the idea.

Ended up in the hospital for two days.  My heart is not beating right.  Its still messed up and they don't know what is causing it.  Have to follow up with doc.  Ended up wearing a heart monitor for a day to see if I could get the 'incident' to happen again.  It didn't.  Figures.  Anyways, didn't get any of the homework done, I'm way behind in class now.  I gotta play catch up for the next couple days. 
Nothing like a little stress to add flavor to your day.  Code School is driving me bonkers.  It doesn't ask good questions and the examples they show are clearly doing one thing but its not what they're looking for, they're looking for something totally different as far as the answer.  So a lot of shooting in the dark to find the answers.  It's either that or waste all the points on buying hints.  Don't want to do that either.
But I'm glad it took this long for me to get behind.  Now just gotta see how fast I can turn it around and fix it.
