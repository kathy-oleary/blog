Week 8

The end is in sight.  I'm so far behind I can no longer see the light of day, but heck one step at a time and I'll get as far as I can.  

Code School hates my guts or my computer does.  It's like doing the bunny hop.  I finish 3 or 4 pages or levels and then all of a sudden it resets and goes back a bunch of pages/levels.  It passed frustrating awhile ago, however the good thing is - because i have to keep rekeying the same things over and over, I'm learning them very very well.  This works too, just is very very slow progress.  I got Fundamentals and Foundations done working on CSS.  Will get there, just takes time.  

Gotta start working on my portfolio and get chunks of it done.  I am going to take Sandra up on her offer to help me out.  Turnabout is fairplay.  I helped her with all the other stuff, she can help me with that.  Go team!
