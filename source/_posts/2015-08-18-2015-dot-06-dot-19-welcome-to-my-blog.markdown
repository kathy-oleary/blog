Week one is done.  Thank gawd!  Crazy hectic week.  A lot of the stuff I was not in the dark on, but was not a pro by all means.  Learned some new stuff and really started learning how and why to use a lot of the terminology.  Putting it together.  Really REALLY want to rewrite the docs for the class to use.  I can see where a lot of people were losing track of where the training was going.  Would rewrite the docs to keep everyone on the same page and moving along.  Who knows, maybe I can get a chance to do it before a ton of homework hits.
