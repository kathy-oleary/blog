Week 9

Last week did NOT go well.  There were some very NOT cool things said about and to me from a few sources.  Honestly, if I was not this close to the end of class, I would have walked right then and there.  But I am going to see this through even if I have to suck up a bunch of people being "challenged".  At that is so me biting my tongue and saying it the nice way. 

Regardless, I'm making more progress on the work.  Starting to speed up which is good.  Today is a rough day, its the 4 yr anniversary of Mom passing and I miss her greatly and I miss my family.  But I just need to find a new family.  I need to move on.  This class and getting a job afterwards is a great step towards that.  Gotta love the rebuilding your life process.

Homework is progressing.  I'm so over Code School its sad.  Will be glad when I can ditch it.  The CSS level is absolutely driving me berserk, but I figured out if I use the computers at the library I have less problems with it doing its flippy flop thing.

We start the group project this week.  I did a chunk towards it last night/this morning.  It's going to be a Choose Your Own Adventure.  Sounds fun and I like it so far.
