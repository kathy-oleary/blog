OMG!

The last week.

Group Project is cranking along.  I was informed today that Akbar is not going to be here Thurs or Fri and he wants me to take over where he left off as he felt I'd be best in the group for doing so.
This was right after I had just said that I had done a lot of the startup work and now I needed to step down so I can work on my projects that I need to get done.  I know I speak english.  I know I do.  Augh!  Oh well, screw it.  Honestly, I am probably the best to take over from where he's leaving off.  I have a grasp of what needs to get done, I have no problem distributing directions and loads of work to people and telling them to get it done.
And I can pretty much judge who can do what and make sure they have suitable instructions to do what needs to get done.  So I'll figure out how to make it work.
Best I can do.  Besides our project is kick butt cool and I want it to happen and happen well.  I can make sure that happens.
